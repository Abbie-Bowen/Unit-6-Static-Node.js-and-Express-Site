          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p  Education as we knew it turned upside down in the past year and half. As a teacher, the sucess of my students became dependent on how we utilized educational technology apps and websites. This new way of teaching and learning completely changed my vision for the future of education and I am excited to be a part of that evolution in a new way. I am looking forward to solving problems with your development team and bringing my passion for education to software development.
