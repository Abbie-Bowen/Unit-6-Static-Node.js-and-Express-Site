Portfolio Project Style Changes:

Overall color scheme (background, text, sidebar, borders) updated on all pages. 

Custom logo & background image for sidebar. Sidebar is also locked to the leftside of the page so it doesn't scroll with the page. 

Main (index) page uses videos as previews that autoplay on mouseover and pause on mouseout. 

Link animation added in matching color scheme to make links stand out more on the page. 

Custom 404 and Error pages with and autoplay video, buttons for error information, and a link back to the main page.
